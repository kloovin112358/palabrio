# palabrio

A word-based browser game built on [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/). Palabrio is a party game that lets you and your friends flex your creative muscles, creating stories out of random words. 

A first-attempt at web development and Git, please excuse all the inefficiences and quirks of this project.

Built in collaboration with Emily Lucas.
